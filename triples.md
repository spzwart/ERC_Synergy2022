triples in open clusters
binaries 
mass transfer
initial distirbutions, what are the birth parameters
link the initial conditions to cluster dynamics.
these are different with different stellar masses
Typical orbit and multiplicity is mass dependent.
Take initial disitrbuions separate from multiplicity discussion

Mostly works on isolated binaires, but what is the effect of the
cluster dynamics on the field binaries, and what effect does this have
on exotic object formation.

stellar evolution vs. stellar dynamics
